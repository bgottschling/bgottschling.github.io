      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky"><b class="intro-text">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</b></a> was born in 1857, fathered by Edward Tsiolkovsky who was a forester, teacher, and minor governmet official. When Knonstantin turned 10 he lost his hearing to scarlet fever, and his mother 3 years after.
      He was never given a formal education as the school would not accept a hearing impaired child. His father aided in schooling him until Konstantin was disciplined enough to conduct his own studies. As a student, and recluse he passed most of his
      time reading books, thinking, and learning mathematics and physics. As a teenager he often thought of space travel, the human condition, and technology. After all, he believed colonizing space would lead to the perfection of the human race. He drew
      much of his inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" style="color:#FFF">Jules Verne</a>, a fiction novelist known for works such as From the Earth to the Moon, and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. He theorized rocket
      propulsion, and space travel guided by his imagination. His status as a pioneer rocket scientist all started from humble beginnings; a disadvantaged child from a middle-class family, held back by personal tragedy in his early life. Today his research
      paves the way for space exploration. </p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Scientific Acheivements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1880-1881: He wrote "Theory of Gases" where he outlined the kinetic theory of gases. To his dismay it had already been discovered 25 years earlier.
      </li>
      <li>
        1892: He published detailed designs for the first all-metal, air-ship.
      </li>
      <li>
        1896: Tsiolkovsky had systematically studied the theory of motion of jet apparatus
      </li>
      <li>
        1897: Tsiolkovsky derived the formula, which he called the "formula of aviation," modernly known as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.
        <br/>
        1897: He built the first russian wind tunnel and developed a method of experimentation using it, making him the first to develop an aerodynamics lab in Russia. 
      </li>
      <li>
        1990: He was given a grant from the Academy of Sciences, he made a survey using models of the simplest shapes and determined the drag coefficients of the sphere, flat plates, cylinders, cones, and other bodies. Tsiolkovsky's work in the field of aerodynamics was a source of ideas for Russian scientist Nikolay Zhukovsky.
      </li>
      <li>
        1903: His most important work, was Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices (Russian: Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами). Tsiolkovsky calculated, using the Tsiolkovsky equation, that the horizontal speed required for a minimal orbit around the Earth is 8,000 m/s (5 miles per second) and that this could be achieved by means of a multistage rocket fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.
      </li>
      <li>
        1911: He published the second part of the work "Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices". Here Tsiolkovsky evaluated the work needed to overcome the force of gravity, determined the speed needed to propel the device into the solar system ("escape velocity"), and examined calculation of flight time.
      </li>
      <li>
        1921: Tsiolkovsky started development on the idea of the hovercraft
      </li>
      <li>
        1926–1929: Tsiolkovsky solved the practical problem regarding the role played by rocket fuel in getting to escape velocity and leaving the Earth. He showed that the final speed of the rocket depends on the rate of gas flowing from it and on how the weight of the fuel relates to the weight of the empty rocket.
      </li>
      <li>
        1929: Tsiolkovsky proposed the construction of multistage rockets in his book Space Rocket Trains
      </li>

    <h2 class="text-center">Closing Statements</h2>
    <p>
      Konstantin Tsiolkovsky did not expect his scientific research to have the profound effect on space exploration that it has today. He championed the idea of diveristy of life in the universe and was the first theorist to advocate human space exploration. He is a testament to discipline and achievement through self-guided curriculum. A remarkable, inspirational individual.
